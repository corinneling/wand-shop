## Wand Repair Shop

While we all know every wizard needs a wand, we don't often think of what happens when something goes wrong and it breaks, or isn't behaving properly.

But, you're not! You don't have to worry about puking up slugs, or accidentally blowing things up anymore. Clone this repo and run `rake start`. Then Ollivander will ask you details about your wand, so he can better repair it.

## Project Info

Project: To create a new program similar to hot dog stand, see original prompt(https://github.com/corinneling/ruby-and-hot-dogs), from the ground up with TDD. I decided to change changed content from hot dogs to wands.

Tools: Minitest, Code Climate, SimpleCov, Travis CI
